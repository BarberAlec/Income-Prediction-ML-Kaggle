# Income-Prediction-ML-Kaggle

(https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcdml1920-income-ind "Link to Kaggle Competition")

* main.py contains prediction model and main body of code
* utility.py contains helper functions including cleaning fucntion and preprocessing functions
* grid_search.py was used for training multiple models at once in different threads

NOTE: my pred_file.csv is not identical to my submission as I acidently deleted the original file.... repeated training with same hyper parametres so should be very similiar results.
